            Hello! I'm a software developer @ A North Group AB. 
            I live in Norra Rörum together with my partner and our two
            dogs. Outside of work, I’m passionate about spending time outdoors.
            Whether it's taking long walks in the woods, hunting, or
            paragliding. Nature plays a big part in my life. calm, focused, and always seeking
            new heights.
