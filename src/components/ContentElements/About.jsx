            Hello! im a software developer @ A North Group AB. 
            I live in small town called Norra Rörum, Skåne together with my partner and our two
            dogs. Outside of work, I’m passionate about spending time outdoors.
            Whether it's taking long walks in the woods, hunting, or
            paragliding. Nature plays a big part in my life and inspires both my
            personal and professional mindset: calm, focused, and always seeking
            new heights.
