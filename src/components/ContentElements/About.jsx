      Hello! My name is Philip Andersson. I was born in 1991 and currently live in Norra Rörum, Skåne, together with my partner and our two dogs.
Outside of work, I’m passionate about spending time outdoors. Whether it's taking long walks in the forest, hunting, or paragliding.
Nature plays a big part in my life and inspires both my personal and professional mindset: calm, focused, and always seeking new heights.
